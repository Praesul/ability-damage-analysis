								RuneScape Player versus Monster (PvM) encounters are fundamentally static. In most
								cases, Non-Player Character (NPC) behavior is structured the same across all
								instances of an encounter. Players execute predetermined sequences of abilities
								called rotations which have been optimized for speed and consistency. The PvM
								Encyclopedia offers publicly available rotations for every boss, although they are
								primarily human-generated through trial and error. We propose that RuneScape can be
								solved and we explore the potential of statistical methods to evaluate both
								individual actions as well as complete rotations. Player-derived damage in a
								rotation can be interpreted as discrete random variables with non-identical
								distributions. We find that the distribution of sequences of abilities obtain
								Gaussian characteristics over time and show that sufficiently long rotations can be
								approximated with a Gaussian Probability Mass Function (PMF). These methods are
								useful for comparative analysis of existing rotations. However, we aim to transcend
								intuition-based rotation optimization through reinforcement learning&#8212;and
								briefly examine the mathematical landscape of solving stochastic Markov Decision
								Processes (MDPs) for massively large spaces in the context of RuneScape combat.
